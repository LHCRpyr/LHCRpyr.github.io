Here's my take on the the scrum framework and the certifications, so you can decide on whether you should invest time in learning it.

I have gone off on a learning tangent these past few weeks, trying to absorb as much information as I can about the [Agile methodology](https://agilemanifesto.org/) or more specifically, the Scrum framework. 

Was it worth spending several weekends learning about the Scrum framework from certified trainers/coaches and even learning about the [Scaled Agile Framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) for leading agile organisations?

*In keeping this article as bite-sized as possible, I won't be describing in detail the scrum framework here but if you're interested in getting an overview, I would suggest the official [quick guide](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/quick-guide-things-scrum) by the Scrum Alliance.*

## Why do I need to learn Agile?

The Agile methodology has evolved from its humble roots as a single team's software development technique into a philosophical mindset for developing complex products and services. The [success stories](https://hbr.org/2016/05/embracing-agile) of companies and  start-ups [(Spotify)](https://www.pmtoday.co.uk/spotify-scaling-agile-model/) that adopted Agile has been a big driver in Agile adoption these past few decades. 

Agile's use has expanded far beyond small-team software development and can be seen being scaled across large business functions [Marketing](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/agile-marketing-a-step-by-step-guide), [Human Resources](https://hbr.org/2018/03/hr-goes-agile), and even [Accounting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-we-create-agile-fpa-department-anders-liu-lindberg/). This means that almost every company wants to reap the benefits of Agile; you being able to prove that you are committed to supporting agile methodologies gives you an opportunity to excel with Agile.

In a [2018 survey on agile transformation](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/2019/11/agile-transformation.pdf) conducted by Deloitte, Singapore companies has responded that they plan to adopt Agile as a "core of IT in three years" even though the survey had also shown that employees are generally not ready to adopt the Agile way of working. 

With Agile leading the way for accelerated company growth, it seems that it's no longer a questions of <u>why</u> we all need to learn Agile but rather <u>when</u> we will all be Agile. Those that fail to transform key business functions, especially IT, will likely fall behind the competition. If you don't know Agile, you are only putting yourself and your company at a disadvantage.

Given the philosophical nature of Agile, it can not be implemented on its own. As such, developmental frameworks (called Agile Frameworks) are used to put the Agile methodology into practise. One of the most popular of which is the  [Scrum framework](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

Getting yourself familiar or even certified in one of these frameworks can be tremendously advantages for your career.

## Scrum is not the same as Agile

Using the [Scrum framework](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) on its own as a means to become Agile is disingenuous. Scrum being a subset of Agile, relies on a Agile culture to work. Building an Agile team without the support of an agile culture will likely result in scrum project failures. 

Here's one example: Scrum describes teams as being self-managing, meaning that no manager is required and teams are trusted to make their own decisions (i.e. no external approvals required).    However, this only works if companies have a culture of trust, allowing employees to make such decisions. This culture of trust and self-management is described by Scrum but provides no answers to how to develop such a culture, for that, you need to learn about change management and organisation behaviour. 

I view scrum as a means to execute on agile methodologies for teams that are still in the midst of agile transformation. It is unlikely that the first organisation you work for is a small agile team (where scrum is most effective), more realistically, you are working or going to work in an organisation that's in the middle of an agile transformation, trying its best to move away from waterfall project management and top heavy hierarchical structures. Scrum is a starting point for becoming an agile team and the team will evolve over time as they become more Agile.

A classic example of how a scrum team can evolve is through observation of the daily scrum meetings (the daily stand-ups). It is likely that with new scrum teams, the scrum masters will have to facilitate meetings by asking the 3 'stand-up questions' (usually via round robin to ensure participation by all team members). With mature scrum teams, even without the presence of the scrum master, the team members are quick to update the rest of the team on their progress identify 'impediments' to their progress.

What is most worrying about new organisations implementing agile is a clear misunderstanding of the role of scrum masters in the agile teams. Many job postings 

## The Scrum Certification Dilemma

In my opinion,the certification is heavily misunderstood due to the terminology used in the framework. A 'scrum master' is a role and not a representation of one's *<u>mastery</u>* of leading scrum teams.  This means that new agile organisations are at risk of giving freshly Certified Scrum Masters too much credit for transforming agile teams.

I would consider the Scrum Master certification to be a validation of your understanding of the fundamentals of scrum and its processes. Real practitioners understand that experience and continuous improvement mindsets are far more valuable than any certification could possibly offer. 

Even the trainers that taught me placed heavy emphasis on developing an agile mindset and continuous learning. After the 16 hour course, I certainly understood the principles and practices of Scrum in service of trying to be Agile. However, it is definitely not enough time  for anyone to be come a proficient Scrum Master. My Scrum trainers left the newly minted certified scum masters with a huge learning resources including books, podcasts and regular events held by the Scrum Community.

I can hear you asking: "Should I get scrum master certified?" If you're about start leading a scrum team as a scrum master, the certification on its own is useless. What is more important takeaway from the course is developing an understanding of the purpose of each activity and how to build an agile mindset. The scrum master is only as good as the team: everything that the scrum master does is in service of developing the team's agility. Being able to make explain the purpose behind scrum activities and helping team members understand the meaning behind scrum events is likely to be more useful than blindly executing the 'rituals.'

If you are new to Agile or Scrum, getting that certification is tremendously useful in accelerating your agile learning journey via Scrum, just remember that the learning does not stop after getting certified.
