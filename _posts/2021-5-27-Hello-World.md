title: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
---

The chinese proverb [千里之行](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step) best describes what I plan to do.
I am pursuing a data-driven career, a difficult journey for an accountant with no computer science background. If you're ready learn with me about data science, accounting, finance and perhaps even home cooking, you have arrived at the right place.

This will be the first of many posts where I share my ideas, research and thought process. Hopefully my ups and downs in my learning journey, will be helpful to many others on this same journey of life.
