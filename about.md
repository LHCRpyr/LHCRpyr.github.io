### Data Analytics for Finance and Accounting

I'm a data analytics trained accountant based in Singapore, on a journey to learn how to further the accounting and data science profession.

My goal is to help other accountants, aspiring data science professionals, and curious minds navigate the journey towards data literacy.

My learning journey in Data Science kicked off in 2018 when I joined an Accounting and Finance focused Data Analytics program at Singapore Management University. Graudating with a specialised Master's degree focused on applied Data Analytics, it sparked an insatiable desired to learn even more about computer science and building data-driven technologies.

Currently, I am working as an accounting supervisor, coaching a team to become data-centric modern accountants. While the day-to-day duties had been focused on management and financial accounting, there are so many opportunities to enhance the company's insghts through applied data analytics which I plan to document on this blog.

While my day job has been keeping me busy, I am thrilled at the idea of tackling some interesting data science projects on my own.

If you're interested in learning how I am applying data science in my work as an accountant or simply curious about my planned projects, this is the place to be.

### Why do you blog?

I read a book, ['Show your Work' by Austin Kleon](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=show+your+work&qid=1622117174&sr=8-1) that inspired me to change the way I thought about social media and teaching. My first step to 'showing my work' was to make my ideas and thoughts public, allowing for conversations and probably even more ideas to form.
I also realised that I needed a way to keep track of my ideas and projects â€“ anything I am thinking about or working on. I want to research things I find interesting, and then document my findings with a public blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. My hope is that other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting. I firmly believe that blogs can spark wonderful conversations, so I welcome emails and comments.
